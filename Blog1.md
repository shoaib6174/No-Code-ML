Why do we need no code ML?

No code Machine learning is a software development technique that allows anyone to create a machine learning model ‘without having coding experience before’ and provides easier and faster process of creating a prediction and lower cost.

As we can see, no code ml has a simpler process than traditional ml so anyone with no code experience can build their own machine learning model for their business or research and become a data-driven team that leads to enhance work performance, make a quicker and more accurate decision.

What is ML 
-

  Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It allows a computer program to learn and improve from data or experience without writing long and complex code.
For example, If we teach kids how apple and lemon look like and tell them to classify given apple and lemon pictures, they will observe attributes of the pictures and tell you which one is apple or lemon.

Computer program can do that too but it doesn’t use eyes to observe.

  If we want our computer program to classify apple and lemon, we will create an machine learning model us using data of apple and orange attributes such as color, shape and tastes then ‘clean and transform’ these data into ‘feature’ or the set of numbers. These features will be used to train a model and make predictions.

Types of ML algorithms

Commonly, Machine Learning can be divided into three main categories according to their purpose as the following: 

•	Unsupervised Learning

•	Supervised Learning 

•	Reinforcement Learning
